## FAQ
**Can I block ads with this firmware?**

Yes! Open `/etc/config/dnscrypt-proxy` with `nano` or `vim` and change `option resolver 'fvz-anyone'` to `option resolver 'default.ns1.adguard.com'`. Then restart DNSCrypt with `service dnscrypt-proxy restart`.

**Do you offer any quality assurance?**

Sort of. I push releases manually after testing the builds on my own C7, which prevents major issues with the releases you can find here. The nightly builds are untested!

**My clients are unable to connect to the internet after flashing this firmware!**

Just reboot your router once and it should work. If it still doesn't work, make sure that `dnscrypt-proxy` is enabled and working. SSH to your router and do `service dnscrypt-proxy enable; service dnscrypt-proxy restart`.

**Can I get this firmware even faster?**

Yes. If you don't use PPPoE or another tunneling protocol, you can remove the line `option mtu_fix 1` in `/etc/config/firewall` to squeeze out another 20-30Mbps.
